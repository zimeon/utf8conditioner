<h1>Software</h1>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="utf8conditioner">utf8conditioner</a></b>: 
 Designed for use with <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open 
 Archives Initiative</a> (OAI) harvesting software. Aims to 
 `fix' bad codes in UTF-8 encoded XML so that XML parsers will
 be able to parse it (albeit with some corruption introduced by
 substitution of dummy characters in place of illegal codes).
<li>Coming soon... <b>Harvie</b>: an OAI harvester written in Java.
